# OsMak IPC Hub - User Guidelines for Unauthenticated Access (Residents & Nurses)

Welcome to the Ospital ng Makati IPC Hub! This guide outlines the features available to you when accessing the application without logging in.

As an unauthenticated user (Resident or Nurse), your access is focused on **reporting new incidents** and **accessing essential clinical resources**. You *cannot* view detailed patient records or advanced analytics dashboards without logging in as an IPC Coordinator.

## 1. Reporting New Incidents (Surveillance Forms)

You have direct access to all incident reporting forms to ensure timely and accurate data submission. Your contributions are vital for maintaining hospital safety and surveillance.

**Available Forms:**

*   **Report HAI Case:** Log new Healthcare-Associated Infections (VAP, CAUTI, SSI, etc.).
*   **Report Notifiable Disease:** Register cases of mandated notifiable diseases.
*   **Register TB Case:** Document new or follow-up Tuberculosis cases.
*   **Isolation Admit:** Record patient admissions to isolation rooms for non-TB cases.
*   **Report Sharp Injury:** Report any needlestick or sharp-related occupational exposures.
*   **Add Lab Report (Antibiogram):** Submit culture and sensitivity results from the laboratory.

**How to Use Forms:**
1.  Navigate to the specific form from the home screen or the "Registry Access" section.
2.  Fill in all required fields.
3.  Ensure patient identifiers and clinical details are accurate.
4.  Click "Submit" to send your report to the IPC team for validation.

**Important Note on Data Privacy:**
When using reporting forms, please enter patient and staff information accurately. Your submitted reports will be held in a "pending" state until reviewed and validated by an authenticated IPC Coordinator.

## 2. Accessing Essential Clinical Resources

You can freely browse and search the hospital's official IPC guidelines and clinical references.

**Available Resources:**

*   **IPC Manual:** Access standardized infection prevention and control policies and procedures.
*   **References:** View clinical care pathways and other evidence-based care documents.
*   **Antibiogram (Culture Hub) - List View:** You can see a summarized list of antibiogram results, useful for general awareness of resistance patterns, but detailed patient-specific data will be anonymized or restricted.

**How to Use Resources:**
1.  Navigate to the "IPC Manual" or "References" sections.
2.  Use the search bar to find specific topics or documents.
3.  Click on a document to read its content.

## 3. Restricted Access Areas

The following areas require an IPC Coordinator login and are **not accessible** to you:

*   **All Dashboards (e.g., HAI Registry, TB Registry, Notifiable Diseases, Isolation Room, Needlestick Injuries, Antibiogram - with full patient data)**: You cannot view aggregated or patient-specific surveillance data directly.
*   **NTP Registration & Dashboard**: Access to the National TB Program registry for detailed patient management and referrals requires coordinator login.
*   **Auditing Modules (Hand Hygiene Audit, Clinical Care Bundles, Area Safety Audit, Action Plan Tracker)**: These tools are for IPC Coordinator-led quality and compliance activities.
*   **Analytics Mode (Executive Briefing)**: Executive-level reports and trend analysis are restricted.
*   **Reporter Analytics**: You cannot view the performance or contributions of individual reporters.
*   **Pending Tasks Dashboard**: This is the IPC Coordinator's inbox for validating submitted reports.

export const HAND_HYGIENE_MD = `# Hand Hygiene Practices (Institutional Guidelines)
**Updated: May 2023**

## I. INTRODUCTION
**1.1.** Hand hygiene is a critical component of infection prevention and control in a healthcare facility which protects both the patient and healthcare worker if done timely and effectively.

## II. OBJECTIVES
**2.1.** To provide guidance in hand hygiene practices and reduce healthcare-associated infections.

## III. SCOPE
**3.1.** This covers the practice of hand hygiene in all levels of care.

## I. DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
**5.1. Patient Zone** – includes the patient and some surfaces and items that are temporarily and exclusively dedicated to them.

**5.2. Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR)** – an alcohol-containing preparation designed for application to the hands to reduce the number of viable microorganisms on the hands.

**5.3. Antimicrobial soap** – soap containing an antiseptic agent.

**5.4. Antiseptic agent** – antimicrobial substances that are applied to the skin to reduce the number of microbial florae. Examples include alcohols, chlorhexidine, chlorine, hexachlorophene, iodine, chloroxylenol (PCMX), quaternary ammonium compounds, and triclosan.

**5.5. Antiseptic handwash** – washing hands with water and soap or other detergents containing an antiseptic agent.

**5.6. Hand antisepsis** - refers to either antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub.

**5.7. Hand hygiene** - a general term that applies to either handwashing, antiseptic handwash, antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis.

**5.8. Persistent activity** –is the prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents or inhibits the proliferation or survival of microorganisms after the application of the product.

**5.9. Surgical hand antisepsis** – antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgical personnel to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations often have persistent antimicrobial activity.

## II. GUIDELINES

### 2.1. FIVE MOMENTS OF HAND HYGIENE (Appendix A)
**2.1.1.** Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help reduce the burden of healthcare-associated infections. It focuses on contact occurring within the patient zone during the delivery of patient care.

**2.1.2. Moment 1. Before touching a patient**
**2.1.2.1.** Clean your hands before touching a patient when approaching them to protect the patient against harmful germs carried on your hands.

**2.1.3. Moment 2. Before a clean/aseptic procedure**
**2.1.3.1.** Clean your hands immediately before accessing a critical site with infectious risk for the patient to protect them against harmful germs, including the patient’s own, entering their body.

**2.1.4. Moment 3. After body fluid exposure risk**
**2.1.4.1.** Clean your hands immediately after an exposure risk to body fluids (and after glove removal). This will protect both you and the healthcare environment from pathogens in blood and body fluids.

**2.1.5. Moment 4. After touching a patient**
**2.1.5.1.** Clean your hands after touching a patient and their immediate surroundings, and when leaving the patient’s side, to protect yourself and the health care environment from harmful microorganisms.

**2.1.6. Moment 5. After touching the patient’s surroundings**
**2.1.6.1.** Clean your hands after touching any object or furniture in the patient’s immediate surroundings when leaving – even if the patient has not been touched – to prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms from inside the patient zone to the rest of the healthcare environment.

### 2.2. GLOVES AND HAND HYGIENE
**2.2.1.** Glove use does not replace the need for hand hygiene.
**2.2.2.** Hand hygiene is performed before putting on and after taking off gloves.
**2.2.3.** Gloves must be worn if exposure to body fluids, potentially infectious material, or chemicals is anticipated.
**2.2.4.** Avoid the reuse of gloves. Do not wear the same pair of gloves to care for more than one patient.
**2.2.5.** When wearing gloves, remove gloves and perform hand hygiene during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to another body site that is not contaminated.

### 2.3. CLEANING WITH SOAP AND WATER
**2.3.1.** Washing hands with soap and water is recommended rather than using ABHR in the following:
**2.3.1.1.** If hands are visibly dirty, soiled, or contaminated with blood or other body fluids.
**2.3.1.2.** After using the toilet.
**2.3.1.3.** When exposure to spore-forming pathogens, including outbreaks of *Clostridium difficile* (a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea), is suspected or proven.
**2.3.2.** The use of soap and water is to remove dirt, organic material, and microorganisms from the hands. Plain soaps have minimal antimicrobial activity.
**2.3.3.** Handwashing with soap and water should be performed for at least **40 to 60 seconds**.

### 2.4. STEPS IN HANDWASHING WITH SOAP AND WATER (Appendix B)
1. Wet hands with water.
2. Apply enough soap to cover all hand surfaces.
3. Rub hands palm to palm.
4. Right palm over left dorsum with interlaced fingers and vice versa.
5. Palm to palm with fingers interlaced.
6. Backs of fingers to opposing palms with fingers interlocked.
7. Rotational rubbing of left thumb clasped in right palm and vice versa.
8. Rotational rubbing, backwards and forwards, with clasped fingers of the right hand in the left palm and vice versa.
9. Rinse hands with water.
10. Dry hands thoroughly with a single-use towel.
11. Use a towel to turn off the faucet.

### 2.5. DRYING HANDS
**2.5.1.** Drying hands after using soap and water is an essential step of hand hygiene after using soap and water because the transmission of microorganisms is more likely to occur with wet skin than with dry skin.
**2.5.2.** Dry hands thoroughly with a method that does not re-contaminate or irritate the hands, such as:
**2.5.2.1.** Manual air drying by the movement of hands.
**2.5.2.2.** Using a single-use paper towel or cloth to pat your hands dry.
**2.5.3.** Towels should not be used multiple times or by various individuals.
**2.5.4.** Warm-air dryers for drying hands are not recommended, as forced air can spread pathogens through water droplets.

### 2.6. CLEANING HANDS WITH ALCOHOL-BASED HAND RUB (ABHR)
**2.6.1.** ABHR is the preferred choice for hand hygiene if hands are not visibly soiled.
**2.6.2.** Use an alcohol-based hand rub as the preferred means for routine hand antisepsis in all other clinical situations if hands are not visibly soiled.
**2.6.3.** ABHR is more effective in killing microorganisms than plain or antimicrobial soaps and water, and it has other significant advantages. The alcohol in ABHR kills microorganisms by denaturing proteins. It also has persistent activity, meaning microorganisms take longer to repopulate the hands.
**2.6.4.** Hand hygiene with ABHR has advantages over hand hygiene with soap and water, including:
**2.6.4.1.** It takes less time.
**2.6.4.2.** ABHR can be placed directly at the point of care.
**2.6.4.3.** Hand hygiene with ABHR does not need sinks, water, or towels.
**2.6.5.** The active ingredient, alcohol, is flammable, so you should be careful and ensure any ABHR is stored away from flames.
**2.6.6.** Soap and alcohol-based hand rubs should not be used concomitantly.
**2.6.7.** ABHR must be performed for **20 to 30 seconds**.

### 2.7. STEPS IN HAND HYGIENE WITH ABHR (Appendix C)
1. Apply a palmful of the product in a cupped hand, covering all surfaces.
2. Rub hands palm to palm.
3. Right palm over left dorsum with interlaced fingers and vice versa.
4. Palm to palm with fingers interlaced.
5. Backs of fingers to opposing palms with fingers interlocked.
6. Rotational rubbing of left thumb clasped in right palm and vice versa.
7. Rotational rubbing, backwards and forwards, with clasped fingers of the right hand in the left palm and vice versa.
8. Once dry, your hands are safe.

### 2.8. LESIONS AND SKIN BREAKS
**2.8.1.** Concomitant use of soap and ABHR may increase the risk of unwanted skin reactions. ABHR helps protect skin integrity compared to handwashing with soap and water.
**2.8.2.** Cuticles, hands, and forearms should be free of significant lesions (such as ulcers, abscesses, and tumor) and cuts. Major cuts and abrasions should be covered with waterproof dressings. Healthcare providers with active lesions should not provide direct patient care or participate in surgery until healed.

### 2.9. FINGERNAILS, NAIL POLISH, AND JEWELRY
**2.9.1.** Long fingernails, nail polish, and jewelry impede hand hygiene and promote bacterial growth on hands.
**2.9.2.** Natural fingernails should be kept short, ideally not extending **0.5 cm (less than 1/4 inch)** beyond the fingertips.
**2.9.3.** Artificial nails or extenders are discouraged while working in clinical areas.
**2.9.4.** If nail polish is worn, it should not be chipped.
**2.9.5.** Wearing jewelry, including rings, is strongly discouraged.
**2.9.6.** Surgical teams should remove jewelry, including rings, bracelets, and watches, before performing surgical hand scrub.

### 2.10. SURGICAL HAND PREPARATION
**2.10.1.** Rings, wristwatches, bracelets, or jewelry must be removed before beginning surgical hand preparation.
**2.10.2.** If hands are visibly soiled, wash hands with plain soap before surgical hand preparation.
**2.10.3.** Remove debris underneath fingernails using a nail cleaner, preferably under running water.
**2.10.4.** The use of brushes is not recommended for surgical hand preparation.
**2.10.5.** Surgical hand antisepsis should be performed using either a suitable antimicrobial soap or suitable ABHR.
**2.10.6.** When performing surgical hand antisepsis using an antimicrobial soap, scrub hands and forearms for the length of time recommended by the manufacturer.
**2.10.7.** When using an alcohol-based hand rub, use sufficient product to keep hands and forearms wet with the hand rub throughout the surgical hand preparation procedure.
**2.10.8.** After application of the alcohol-based hand rub as recommended, allow hands and forearms to dry thoroughly before donning sterile gloves.

### 2.11. STEPS IN SURGICAL HAND PREPARATION TECHNIQUE WITH ABHR (Appendix D)
1. Put approximately **5mL (3 doses)** of ABHR in the palm of your left hand, using your other arm's elbow to operate the dispenser.
2. Dip the fingertips of your right hand in the hand rub to decontaminate under the nails (**5 seconds**).
3. Smear the hand and rub on the right forearm up to the elbow. Ensure the whole skin area is covered using circular movements around the forearm until the hand rub fully evaporates (**10 to 15 seconds**).
4. Put approximately **5mL (3 doses)** of ABHR in the palm of your right hand, using your other arm's elbow to operate the dispenser.
5. Dip the fingertips of your left hand in the hand rub to decontaminate under the nails (**5 seconds**).
6. Smear the hand rub on the left forearm up to the elbow. Ensure that the whole skin area is covered by circular movements around the forearm until the hand rub has fully evaporated (**10 to 15 seconds**).
7. Put approximately **5mL (3 doses)** of ABHR in the palm of your left hand, using the elbow of your other arm to operate the distributor. Rub both hands at the same time up to the wrist.
8. Cover the whole surface of the hands up to the wrist with ABHR, rubbing palm against palm with a rotating movement.
9. Rub the back of the left hand, including the wrist, moving the palm back and forth, and vice-versa.
10. Rub palm against palm back and forth with fingers interlinked.
11. Rub the back of the fingers by holding them in the palm of the other hand with a sideways back-and-forth movement.
12. Rub the thumb of the left hand by rotating it in the clasped palm of the right hand and vice versa.
13. When the hands are dry, sterile surgical clothing and gloves can be donned.

### 2.12. STEPS IN DONNING GLOVES (Appendix E)
1. Take out a glove from its original box.
2. Touch only a restricted surface of the glove corresponding to the wrist (at the top edge of the cuff).
3. Don the first glove.
4. Take the second glove with the bare hand and touch only a restricted surface of the glove corresponding to the wrist.
5. To avoid touching the skin of the forearm with the gloved hand, turn the external surface of the glove to be donned on the folded fingers of the gloved hands, thus permitting to glove the second hand.
6. Once gloved, hands should not touch anything else not defined by indications and conditions of glove use.

### 2.13. STEPS IN DOFFING GLOVES (Appendix F)
1. Pinch the glove at the wrist level to remove it without touching the skin of the forearm, and peel it away from the hand, thus allowing the glove to turn inside out.
2. Hold the removed glove in the gloved hand and slide the fingers of the ungloved hand inside between the glove and the wrist. Remove the second glove by rolling it down the hand and fold into the first glove.
3. Discard the removed gloves.
4. Do hand hygiene by rubbing with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing with soap and water.

### 2.14. STEPS IN DONNING STERILE GLOVES (Appendix G)
1. Perform hand hygiene before an aseptic procedure by hand rubbing or hand washing.
2. Check the package for integrity. Open the first non-sterile packaging by peeling it entirely off the heat seal to expose the second sterile wrapper without touching it.
3. Place the second sterile package on a clean, dry surface without touching the surface. Open the package and fold it towards the bottom to unfold the paper and keep it open.
4. Using the thumb and index finger of one hand, carefully grasp the folded cuff edge of the glove.
5. Slip the other hand into the glove in a single movement, keeping the folded cuff at the wrist level.
6. Pick up the second glove by sliding the fingers of the gloved hand underneath the cuff of the glove.
7. In a single movement, slip the second glove onto the ungloved hand while avoiding any contact/resting of the gloved hand on the surface other than the glove to be donned (contact/resting constitutes a lack of asepsis and requires a change of glove).
8. After donning both gloves, adjust the fingers and interdigital spaces until the gloves fit comfortably.
9. Unfold the cuff of the first gloved hand by gently slipping the fingers of the other hand inside the folds, making sure to avoid any contact with a surface other than the outer surface of the glove (Lack of asepsis required change of gloves).
10. The hands are gloved and must touch exclusively sterile devices or the previously disinfected patient’s body area.

### 2.15. STEPS IN DOFFING STERILE GLOVES (Appendix H)
1. Remove the first glove by peeling it back with the fingers of the opposite hand. Remove the glove by rolling it inside to the second finger joints (do not remove it completely).
2. Remove the other glove by turning its outer edge on the fingers of the partially ungloved hand.
3. Remove the glove by turning it inside out entirely to ensure that the skin of the healthcare worker is always and exclusively in contact with the inner surface of the glove.
4. Discard gloves.
5. Perform hand hygiene after glove removal according to the recommended indication.

### 2.16. CHOOSING A DISINFECTANT FOR HAND HYGIENE
**2.16.1.** Select alcohol-based hand rubs with **60-95% alcohol** for broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.
**2.16.2.** Ensure the disinfectant is effective against commonly encountered pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
**2.16.3.** Choose formulations that are safe for frequent use and minimize skin irritation.
**2.16.4.** Prefer products with added emollients to prevent skin dryness.
**2.16.5.** Use products approved by regulatory agencies such as the **FDA, WHO, or DOH**.
**2.16.6.** Opt for products that are quick-drying, non-sticky, and leave no residue.
**2.16.7.** Choose dispensers that are easy to access and operate in clinical settings.
**2.16.8.** Avoid disinfectants with excessive fragrance or unnecessary additives.

export const ISOLATION_PRECAUTIONS_MD = `# Isolation Precautions (Institutional Guidelines)
**Updated: May 2023**

## I. OBJECTIVES
**1.1.** To provide guidance on the standardized implementation of isolation precautions to prevent the transmission of infectious agents within the healthcare facility. These guidelines aim to ensure the safety of patients, healthcare workers, and visitors by outlining appropriate use of standard and transmission-based precautions, including contact, droplet, and airborne isolation.

## II. SCOPE
**2.1.** This guideline includes isolation precautions for all healthcare providers.

## III. DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
**3.1. Airborne transmission** – occurs when microorganisms are aerosolized into tiny particles that become suspended in the air and travel on air currents. This can happen when an infected person coughs, talks, or sneezes.

**3.2. Contact transmission** – occurs when microorganisms are transmitted from one infected or colonized person to another via direct or indirect contact.

**3.3. Droplet transmission** – occurs via sprays or splashes of respiratory secretions. Droplets are small amounts of liquid particles that range in size from larger respiratory droplets to smaller “aerosols” and come from the lungs, mouth, or nose that are expelled into the air when people cough, sneeze or even talk.

**3.4. Natural ventilation** – is when natural forces, such as wind, move air in and out of a room.

**3.5. Standard Precautions** – a group of infection prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed diagnosis or presumed infection status.

**3.6. Transmission-Based Precautions** – are the second tier of basic infection control and are to be used in addition to Standard Precautions for patients who may be infected or colonized with certain infectious agents for which additional precautions are needed to prevent infection transmission.

## IV. GUIDELINES

### 4.1. STANDARD PRECAUTION
**4.1.1.** Standard precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices applied to all patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status. These measures are based on risk assessment and include the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to safeguard both healthcare workers and patients from the spread of infections.

**4.1.2. Hand Hygiene**
**4.1.2.1.** Avoid unnecessary contact with surfaces near the patient to prevent contaminating clean hands or transferring pathogens from hands to surfaces.
**4.1.2.2.** Wash hands with soap and water when visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, or visibly soiled with blood or body fluids.
**4.1.2.3.** If hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol-based hand rub for hand decontamination.
**4.1.2.4.** Perform hand hygiene in the following situations:
- Before direct contact with a patient
- After contact with blood, body fluids, excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or wound dressings
- After contact with a patient’s intact skin
- When transitioning from a contaminated to a clean body site during patient care
- After contact with objects in the immediate patient environment
- After removing gloves

**4.1.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**
**4.1.3.1.** Use PPE when contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated.
**4.1.3.2.** Change gloves between tasks and procedures on the same patient when moving from a contaminated body site to a clean one.
**4.1.3.3.** Wear gowns appropriate to the task to protect skin and prevent contamination of clothing. Remove gowns and perform hand hygiene before exiting the patient’s room.
**4.1.3.4.** Use appropriate PPE to protect the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures likely to produce splashes or sprays.

**4.1.4. Respiratory Hygiene and Cough Etiquette**
**4.1.4.1.** Cover mouth and nose with tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing. Dispose of tissues properly and perform hand hygiene immediately after.
**4.1.4.2.** Post instructions on respiratory hygiene and hand hygiene in waiting areas of both outpatient and inpatient settings.

**4.1.5. Patient Placement**
**4.1.5.1.** Patients who pose a transmission risk should ideally be placed in single-patient rooms. Cohorting may be done for those with the same confirmed infection.
**4.1.5.2.** Placement should consider:
- The transmission route of the infectious agent
- The patient’s risk for transmission
- The vulnerability of nearby patients to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
- Availability of single-patient rooms
- Appropriateness of cohorting

**4.1.6. Patient-Care Equipment and Devices**
**4.1.6.1.** Remove organic material from instruments before high-level disinfection or sterilization using recommended cleaning agents.
**4.1.6.2.** Use PPE appropriate to the contamination level when handling visibly soiled equipment.

**4.1.7. Environmental Cleaning**
**4.1.7.1.** Cleaning frequency should be based on the level of contact and visible soiling.
**4.1.7.2.** Disinfect high-touch and patient-near surfaces (e.g., bed rails, doorknobs, and toilet surfaces) more frequently than low-touch surfaces.

**4.1.8. Textiles and Laundry**
**4.1.8.1.** Handle used linens with minimal agitation to reduce the dispersion of contaminants into the air and surrounding surfaces.

**4.1.9. Safe Injection Practices**
**4.1.9.1.** Use aseptic techniques to prevent contamination of sterile equipment.
**4.1.9.2.** Do not reuse syringes for multiple patients, even with needle or cannula changes.
**4.1.9.3.** Prefer single-dose vials. When multidose vials are necessary, ensure both syringe and needle are sterile with each entry.

**4.1.10. Infection Control During Lumbar Puncture Procedures**
**4.1.10.1.** Wear a surgical mask when inserting a catheter or injecting substances into the spinal canal or subdural space.

### 4.2. TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTION
**4.2.1.** In addition to standard precautions, transmission-based precautions are used for patients with documented or suspected infection or colonization with highly transmissible or epidemiologically-important pathogens for which additional precautions are needed to prevent transmission.
**4.2.2.** The duration of transmission-based precautions is extended for immunosuppressed patients with viral infections due to the prolonged shedding of viral agents that may be transmitted to others.

#### 4.2.3. CONTACT PRECAUTIONS
**Indications**: Implemented for patients with suspected or confirmed infections spread through direct physical contact or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces, equipment, or the environment (e.g., MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, draining abscesses, incontinence, or profuse diarrhea).

**Patient Placement**:
- Place patients in single rooms whenever possible.
- If unavailable, prioritize high-transmitters, maintain 1m (3ft) distance, and use privacy curtains/barriers.
- Avoid rooming with immunocompromised individuals.
- Avoid shared toilet facilities.

**PPE**:
- Wear clean, non-sterile gown and gloves before entering.
- Remove and discard PPE prior to exiting and perform hand hygiene immediately.
- Use a new set of PPE for each patient in multi-bed areas.

**Transport**:
- Limit to essential procedures.
- Cover wounds or lesions during transport.
- Perform hand hygiene and remove PPE before exiting; don clean PPE upon arrival at destination.

#### 4.2.4. DROPLET PRECAUTIONS
**Indications**: Infections transmitted through respiratory droplets generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking (e.g., Bordetella pertussis, seasonal influenza, Neisseria meningitidis, certain pneumonias). These droplets usually travel short distances (<1m/3ft) and do not remain suspended.

**Patient Placement**:
- Assign private rooms whenever possible.
- If unavailable, prioritize single rooms for patients with frequent coughing.
- Cohorting is acceptable for the same pathogen.
- Maintain 1m (3ft) separation between beds and draw privacy curtains.

**PPE**:
- Wear a surgical or procedural mask upon entry.
- Use additional PPE (eye protection, gown, gloves) based on procedure risk.

**Transport**:
- Limit to medically necessary procedures.
- Instruct the patient to wear a surgical mask and follow cough etiquette.

#### 4.2.5. AIRBORNE PRECAUTIONS
**Indications**: Infections transmitted through airborne particles capable of remaining suspended over long distances (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Measles, Varicella-zoster).

**Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR)**:
- Negative pressure airflow.
- 6–12 air changes per hour (ACH).
- Exhaust air directed outdoors away from populated areas.
- Doors must remain closed except for entry/exit.

**PPE**:
- Wear a fit-tested N95 respirator or equivalent before entry.
- Perform a seal check with each use.

**Transport**:
- Limit to essential diagnostic/therapeutic procedures.
- Patient must wear a surgical mask and practice cough etiquette.
- Cover any exposed skin lesions (e.g., varicella).

## V. MULTIMODAL STRATEGIES
**5.1. System Change**: Standardized isolation warnings, online training, and IPC Online Hub references.
**5.2. Training**: self-paced E-Course modules; biennial training for relevant staff.
**5.3. Monitoring**: Compliance monitoring via IPC Assessment Tools (IPCAT) and Quality/Safety Walkarounds.
**5.4. Culture Change**: Awareness activities during National and International IPC Week.

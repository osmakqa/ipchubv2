# Guidelines for Hand Hygiene Practices

## 1. Introduction
Hand hygiene is a critical component of infection prevention and control in a healthcare facility which protects both the patient and healthcare worker if done timely and effectively.

## 2. Objectives
To provide guidance in hand hygiene practices and reduce healthcare-associated infections.

## 3. Scope
This covers the practice of hand hygiene in all levels of care.

## 4. Definitions and Acronyms
*   **4.1 Patient Zone** – includes the patient and some surfaces and items that are temporarily and exclusively dedicated to them.
*   **4.2 Alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR)** – an alcohol-containing preparation designed for application to the hands to reduce the number of viable microorganisms on the hands.
*   **4.3 Antimicrobial soap** – soap containing an antiseptic agent.
*   **4.4 Antiseptic agent** – antimicrobial substances that are applied to the skin to reduce the number of microbial florae. Examples include alcohols, chlorhexidine, chlorine, hexachlorophene, iodine, chloroxylenol (PCMX), quaternary ammonium compounds, and triclosan.
*   **4.5 Antiseptic handwash** – washing hands with water and soap or other detergents containing an antiseptic agent.
*   **4.6 Hand antisepsis** – refers to either antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub.
*   **4.7 Hand hygiene** – a general term that applies to either handwashing, antiseptic handwash, antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis.
*   **4.8 Persistent activity** – the prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents or inhibits the proliferation or survival of microorganisms after the application of the product.
*   **4.9 Surgical hand antisepsis** – antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgical personnel to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations often have persistent antimicrobial activity.

## 5. Guidelines

### 5.1 Five Moments of Hand Hygiene
Developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help reduce the burden of healthcare-associated infections. It focuses on contact occurring within the patient zone during the delivery of patient care.

*   **Moment 1: Before touching a patient** – Clean your hands before touching a patient when approaching them to protect the patient against harmful germs carried on your hands.
*   **Moment 2: Before a clean/aseptic procedure** – Clean your hands immediately before accessing a critical site with infectious risk for the patient to protect them against harmful germs, including the patient’s own, entering their body.
*   **Moment 3: After body fluid exposure risk** – Clean your hands immediately after an exposure risk to body fluids (and after glove removal). This will protect both you and the healthcare environment from pathogens in blood and body fluids.
*   **Moment 4: After touching a patient** – Clean your hands after touching a patient and their immediate surroundings, and when leaving the patient’s side, to protect yourself and the healthcare environment from harmful microorganisms.
*   **Moment 5: After touching the patient’s surroundings** – Clean your hands after touching any object or furniture in the patient’s immediate surroundings when leaving – even if the patient has not been touched – to prevent the spread of harmful microorganisms from inside the patient zone to the rest of the healthcare environment.

### 5.2 Gloves and Hand Hygiene
1. Glove use does not replace the need for hand hygiene.
2. Hand hygiene is performed before putting on and after taking off gloves.
3. Gloves must be worn if exposure to body fluids, potentially infectious material, or chemicals is anticipated.
4. Avoid the reuse of gloves. Do not wear the same pair of gloves to care for more than one patient.
5. When wearing gloves, remove gloves and perform hand hygiene during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to another body site that is not contaminated.

### 5.3 Cleaning with Soap and Water
Washing hands with soap and water is recommended rather than using ABHR in the following:
1. If hands are visibly dirty, soiled, or contaminated with blood or other body fluids.
2. After using the toilet.
3. When exposure to spore-forming pathogens, including outbreaks of Clostridium difficile, is suspected or proven.
4. Handwashing with soap and water should be performed for at least 40 to 60 seconds.

### 5.4 Steps in Handwashing with Soap and Water
1.  Wet hands with water.
2.  Apply enough soap to cover all hand surfaces.
3.  Rub hands palm to palm.
4.  Right palm over left dorsum with interlaced fingers and vice versa.
5.  Palm to palm with fingers interlaced.
6.  Backs of fingers to opposing palms with fingers interlocked.
7.  Rotational rubbing of left thumb clasped in right palm and vice versa.
8.  Rotational rubbing, backwards and forwards, with clasped fingers of the right hand in the left palm and vice versa.
9.  Rinse hands with water.
10. Dry hands thoroughly with a single-use towel.
11. Use a towel to turn off the faucet.

### 5.5 Drying Hands
1. Drying hands after using soap and water is an essential step because the transmission of microorganisms is more likely to occur with wet skin.
2. Dry hands thoroughly with a method that does not re-contaminate or irritate the hands.
3. Manual air drying or single-use paper towels are acceptable. 
4. Warm-air dryers are not recommended as forced air can spread pathogens.

### 5.6 Cleaning Hands with Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR)
1. ABHR is the preferred choice for hand hygiene if hands are not visibly soiled.
2. ABHR is more effective in killing microorganisms than plain soap and has persistent activity.
3. ABHR must be performed for 20 to 30 seconds.

### 5.7 Steps in Hand Hygiene with ABHR
1. Apply a palmful of the product in a cupped hand, covering all surfaces.
2. Rub hands palm to palm.
3. Right palm over left dorsum with interlaced fingers and vice versa.
4. Palm to palm with fingers interlaced.
5. Backs of fingers to opposing palms with fingers interlocked.
6. Rotational rubbing of left thumb clasped in right palm and vice versa.
7. Rotational rubbing, backwards and forwards, with clasped fingers of the right hand in the left palm and vice versa.
8. Once dry, your hands are safe.

### 5.8 Lesions and Skin Breaks
1. Cuticles, hands, and forearms should be free of significant lesions.
2. Major cuts and abrasions should be covered with waterproof dressings.
3. Healthcare providers with active lesions should not provide direct patient care until healed.

### 5.9 Fingernails, Nail Polish, and Jewelry
1. Natural fingernails should be kept short (less than 0.5 cm).
2. Artificial nails are discouraged.
3. Jewelry, including rings, is strongly discouraged in clinical areas.

### 5.10 Surgical Hand Preparation
1. Remove all jewelry before beginning.
2. If hands are visibly soiled, wash with plain soap first.
3. Use a nail cleaner for debris under fingernails.
4. Brushes are not recommended for surgical hand preparation.

### 5.11 Steps in Surgical Hand Preparation (ABHR Formulation)
1. Put ~5mL (3 doses) of ABHR in left palm.
2. Decontaminate under right fingernails (5 seconds).
3. Smear on right forearm up to elbow until evaporated (10-15 seconds).
4. Repeat for left side (~5mL, left fingernails, left forearm).
5. Apply another ~5mL to rub both hands up to wrists simultaneously.
6. Cover whole surface of hands (palm to palm, back of hands, interlinked fingers).
7. Once dry, don sterile clothing and gloves.

### 5.12 Steps in Donning Gloves
1. Take out a glove from the original box.
2. Touch only the restricted surface corresponding to the wrist (top edge of cuff).
3. Don the first glove.
4. Repeat for the second glove, avoiding contact between gloved fingers and the skin of the forearm.

### 5.13 Steps in Doffing Gloves
1. Pinch the glove at wrist level and peel it away, turning it inside out.
2. Slide fingers of the ungloved hand inside the remaining glove and roll it down.
3. Discard and perform hand hygiene.

### 5.14 Steps in Donning Sterile Gloves
1. Perform hand hygiene.
2. Open non-sterile packaging carefully.
3. Place sterile package on a clean, dry surface and unfold.
4. Grasp the folded cuff of the first glove and slip hand in.
5. Pick up the second glove by sliding gloved fingers under its cuff.
6. Slip second glove on and adjust fit.

### 5.15 Steps in Doffing Sterile Gloves
1. Peel back first glove to the second finger joints (do not remove entirely).
2. Remove the second glove by turning its outer edge on the fingers of the partially ungloved hand.
3. Remove completely turning inside out to ensure skin only touches the inner surface.
4. Perform hand hygiene.

### 5.16 Choosing a Disinfectant for Hand Hygiene
1. Select ABHR with 60-95% alcohol concentration.
2. Ensure effectiveness against common pathogens.
3. Choose formulations with emollients to prevent dryness.
4. Use products approved by regulatory agencies (FDA, WHO, DOH).
